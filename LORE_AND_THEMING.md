## 🏛️ The Final Boss: Emperor Kha-Sekhem-Ra "The Undying"

### Historical Inspiration
**Emperor Kha-Sekhem-Ra** (The Eternal Sun-Power)
- **Translation:** "Kha" (risen), "Sekhem" (power), "Ra" (sun god)
- **Title:** "The Undying Emperor" / "He Who Defied Death"
- **Era:** Fictional, inspired by Old Kingdom (2686-2181 BCE)

### The Curse of Immortality

**The Legend:**
> In the age when pyramids touched the heavens, Emperor Kha-Sekhem-Ra ruled with absolute power. Obsessed with eternal life, he performed forbidden rituals to steal the immortality of the gods themselves. He consumed the essence of Ra at noon, drank from the waters of the Duat (underworld), and bound his soul to golden artifacts.

> When the gods discovered his blasphemy, Anubis, Guardian of the Dead and Weigher of Hearts, was commanded to deliver judgment. But Kha-Sekhem-Ra could not be killed—his immortality was complete. So Anubis enacted a worse fate: **Eternal imprisonment in the Timeless Catacombs**, where time itself stands still, and the emperor would exist forever, alone, forgotten, unable to die.

> The entrance was sealed. The tomb erased from maps. His name struck from monuments. But the curse had a condition: *"When a mortal soul breaches the seal and awakens the stillness, the Undying shall rise once more."*

### Boss Characteristics

**Visual Design:**
- Pharaoh with golden death mask (more elaborate than Tutankhamun's)
- Body wrapped in ancient, glowing bandages
- Golden crook and flail (pharaoh symbols)
- Floating debris of his shattered tomb orbiting him
- Eyes glowing with stolen divine power
- Partially skeletal, partially preserved (immortality gone wrong)

**Thematic Powers:**
- **Time Dominance:** Can slow/stop time in areas (counters player's mechanic)
- **Eternal Regeneration:** Health regenerates unless defeated quickly
- **Divine Wrath:** Summons manifestations of gods he defied
- **Cursed Servants:** Summons enhanced versions of enemies

**Dialogue (if used):**
- *"Finally... a soul to break my eternal silence..."*
- *"You have freed me from Anubis's prison, now become mine!"*
- *"Time means nothing to one who cannot die!"*
